          <h2>Welcome to my nightmare.</h2>
          <p>Reader, I am angry. Food media is a stale, terrible state of the boring. Lifestyle blogs are hardly more than "look at the lightroom edits I made", and may likely be the single biggest consumers to demand for 50mm and macro lenses.</p>

          <!--- screen cap of some basic bitch's blog

          <figcaption><i>FUCK</i> these people.</figcaption>

          <p>It has become an industry of simplicity, of trends, of ignorance of sustainability, of nothing more than #foodporn, HDR and oversaturation of the same lighting and stylings as fast as they can be churned out, with no regard to the substance of your recipe. In fact, I challenge you to find a recipe from a lifestyle blog that offers a unique take a particular dish, with more than "adapted from (x)" as it's modifier. Best of luck to you. </p>

          <p>I am not here for that. I am here to rant, rave, and be disgusted. I am here to display my increased blood pressure in the form of 900 or so words, but I am also here to help you. <b>I want us to get back to basics. I want to get away from cheese covered plates and bottled dressings.</b> </p>

          <p>I intend to use this site, not to drag content creators--but to be continually appalled at food trends, and to offer <i>better</i>, more realistic versions of popular recipes. Your pictures of muffin tin frittatas look amazing, Kelsie. But if I can't replicate that result at home, what's the point? 
          </p>

          <p>So let's do this. Let's buck the trend. Let's make food better, instead of just taking better pictures.
          </p>

          <p>Join me in saying: Fuck Your Food Blog.</p>

          <p>And let's make food better. 
          </p>

        <p>It don't matter. None of this matters.</p>
        <p>But if it did, I'd tell you that I'm a guy in his mid 30s that spent almost 2 decades working every terrible restaurant job there was, from the bottom to the top. My favorite color is blue, and my favorite food is corn dogs.</p>
